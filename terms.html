        <h2>Service description</h2>
        <p>Spezhe provides voice-to-text transcription, dictation controls, and audio processing for spoken content. The app runs locally on your device, converting your speech to text that you can use in any application.</p>

        <h2>Your content</h2>
        <p>You retain ownership of content you create in Spezhe. All audio and transcription processing happens locally on your device. It is your sole responsibility to ensure you have the right to record and transcribe any audio content.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>
        <p>Spezhe is currently free to use. If pricing changes in the future, we will update these terms and provide notice in the app.</p>

        <h2>On-device AI processing</h2>
        <p>Spezhe uses open-source Whisper models to transcribe your audio entirely on your device. No audio data is sent to third-party servers—all processing happens locally. We reserve the right to introduce optional cloud-based features in the future, in which case we will update these terms and clearly indicate when data leaves your device.</p>

        <h2>Acceptable use</h2>
        <p>Do not misuse the service, attempt to access non-public areas, or interfere with the normal operation of Spezhe. You agree to use the app in compliance with applicable laws and these terms.</p>

        <h2>Third-party services</h2>
        <p>Spezhe may rely on third-party platforms (such as Apple services) to deliver features. Their terms may also apply to your use of Spezhe.</p>

        <h2>Termination</h2>
        <p>We may suspend or terminate your access if there is a violation of these terms or if required by law.</p>

        <h2>Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>Spezhe is provided "AS IS" without warranties of any kind, express or implied. We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free service, and we make no guarantees regarding transcription accuracy.</p>

        <h2>User responsibility</h2>
        <p>You are solely responsible for how you use transcriptions generated by Spezhe. We are not liable for any consequences arising from your reliance on transcribed content, including but not limited to errors, omissions, or misinterpretations. You should always review and verify transcriptions before using them for any important purpose.</p>

        <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Spezhe and Kin-Yee are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the service.</p>

        <h2>Governing law</h2>
        <p>These terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Netherlands. Any disputes arising from these terms or your use of Spezhe shall be handled by the courts of the Netherlands.</p>
