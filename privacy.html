        <h2>Analytics</h2>
        <p>Spetra collects aggregate, anonymous statistics, such as the percentage of users who use specific features, to improve our application. We automatically collect certain non-personal information when you visit, use, or navigate the Spetra website and app. This information includes device and usage details like your device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, coarse location, and other technical information. We primarily use this information for maintaining the security, performance, stability and operation of our applications and for internal analytics and reporting.</p>
        <p>Spetra uses services provided by Mixpanel, a business analytics service company. Mixpanel provides us with the means to track user interactions within our apps. The tracked data is anonymous and used to identify usage trends, not individual usage. The data collected includes information about how and when you use our apps, which helps us make improvements to our services. For more information about Mixpanel's privacy practices, you can read <a href="https://mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy/">Mixpanel's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h2>Data storage</h2>
        <p>All audio recordings and transcriptions are stored exclusively on the user's device. We do not have access to this data unless explicit permission is granted by the user. Once data is deleted, it is permanently removed and cannot be recovered. Rest assured, your personal content remains private, secure, and accessible only by you.</p>

        <h2>Third-party AI processing</h2>
        <p>Spetra is designed to run locally and does not send your audio or transcription data to our servers. If we ever introduce optional features that rely on third-party AI services, we will clearly disclose when your data would be transmitted and update this policy accordingly. By utilizing any such features, you consent to the transmission of your data to the respective third-party services.</p>

        <h2>Use of collected information</h2>
        <p>We use the information collected to enhance Spetra's functionality and customer support. We do not share personal information with outside parties unless it is necessary to accomplish Spetra's functionalities. We may share anonymous, aggregate statistics with third parties. We may also disclose your information in response to legal requirements, to exercise our legal rights, to defend against legal claims, to prevent illegal activities, or to protect our rights and property. In the event of a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of our assets, user information may be among the transferred assets.</p>

        <h2>International transfers of information</h2>
        <p>Your information may be processed, stored, and used outside of the country where you are located. Data privacy laws vary across jurisdictions, and different laws may apply to your data depending on where it is processed or stored.</p>

        <h2>Updates to this policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Last updated" date and will be effective immediately upon being accessible. If we make significant changes, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this policy often to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.</p>

        <h2>Consent</h2>
        <p>By using our site or apps, you consent to this privacy policy.</p>
